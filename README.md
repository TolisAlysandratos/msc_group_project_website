# Group Project - "Moodify" Website (front end)
MSc Computing Science - Imperial College London

This is the front end of the web app created for the Group Project of the degree. 
This app generates spotify music playlists based on the user's mood. The user chooses up to three emojis reflecting their mood. The back end return three adjectives related to those emojis, from which the user can select up to three again. Then they presented with a spotify playlist containing tracks which reflect the chosen "moods".

Valence and arousal values are used to create the connection between adjectives and tracks to generate the playlists. The emojis/adjectives are associated with valence and arousal values found in psychological studies. The spotify tracks in our database are rated by volunteer users in valence/arousal terms. The playlists are generated by choosing tracks close to the valence/arousal values of the chosen adjectives.

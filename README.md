# Group Project - "Moodify" Website (front end)
MSc Computing Science - Imperial College London

This is the front end of the web app created for our Group Project. 
This app generates Spotify music playlists based on the user's mood. The user chooses up to three emojis reflecting their mood. The back end returns a number adjectives related to those emojis. The user can select up to three adjectives too. The app then generates a Spotify playlist containing tracks which reflect the chosen "moods".

Valence and arousal values are used to create the connection between adjectives and playlist tracks. The emojis/adjectives are associated with valence and arousal values found in psychological studies. The spotify tracks in our database are rated by volunteer users in valence/arousal terms using a separate data collection website.
